            <p> My mom grew up in the Dominican Republic which means that the idea of education was very important but due to everyone being so poor
                not everyone was able to go to school. However due to my grandparents belief in education they were able to hustle and get some money in order
                to get her into a school.

            <p> Since education was so important the big dream goal was always college. Due to this my mom decided she was gonna pursue her dream of GOING in doing this it lead to working multiple jobs while attending school to eventually get into college and graduate with a 4 year degree.

            <p> This is undoubtedly a huge moment in everyone's life but for my mom it was a point of relief because she was able to have a partner who fully supported her through all she wanted. Not only this but she found the man she truly loved to which she has been engage 19 years with.  </p>
